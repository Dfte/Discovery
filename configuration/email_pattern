# This file contains the email pattern that should be used 
# Actually there are 8 format supported but you can add
# your in this file and in the python script.
# To select a pattern just copy paste one of the eight following values :
# firstname.lastname 
# lastname.firstname 
# firstnamelastname
# lastnamefirstname
# f.lastname 
# l.firstname 
# flastname 
# lfirstname 

#For example if you want to create mail list that suits  firstname.lastname pattern
#You'll have to complete the line this way :
pattern:firstname.lastname

#NOTE : if the pattern is not completed or the value is not handled, 
#then we will create as much emails list as they are formats (8 actually)
